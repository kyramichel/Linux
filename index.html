           Steps to install Ubuntu Server on VM Virtual Box.
          
       </p>


    <h2>Download Ubuntu Server and Virtual Box:</h2>

    <p> Go to www.ubuntu.com and chose download Ubuntu Server. 
    
    I use the version 18.04.5 LTS. You can chose Option 3 -> Altenative downloads -> Get the previous LTS.     
    </p>

<p> Go to www.virtualbox.org then Downloads (left pane)
Click download VirtualBox-6.1.16 file  for Windows hosts or MacOS hosts (depending on the system you are using). Next, download Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack (for all platforms).
</p>

    
    <p> Go to downloads folder and check to make sure you have the software needed:</p>
    
    <img src="files_downloaded.jpg" alt="files downloaded" width="402" height="65">
    
    <p>Click to run the Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack file. This will open the Virtual Box. Accept the defaults and the legal agreement.</p>
    
    <h2> Use Virtual Box to generate a Linux server virtual machine </h2>
    
    <p> Open VirtualBox. Click Machine/New. Give a name to your machine (ex: admin). Type: Linux and chose default settings. Memory size: chose around to the green line (required)  - check how much memory you have available). Hard disk: Create a virtual hard disk now, Accept default VDI (VirtualBox disk image) Storage on physical hard disk: fixed size (you can also chose dynamically allocated) File location and size: chose as required and depending on your available memory. Click create. </p>
    
Next, go to Settings/Network: Check Enable adaptor. Change  Nat to Bridge Adaptor. (The adaptor now will get an IP address on the same network as your computer, instead of using Nat)
    
<h2> Start the installation </h2>    
 
<p>Click Start/Empty. Select the ubuntu.iso file that you downloaded. (that's a virtual dvd). Click start. 
    
Use the arrow keys to make selections.
Chose language, select Ubuntu Server.
It's detecting the (virtual) hardware, loading the drivers needed for the boot process, configuring the network.
Choose host name (Linux Server), continue, Add user : admin, create a password. Don't use encryption, continue.

Partitioning method: use entire disk  ( without LVM), format the hard disk (yes)
Finish partitioning and write to disk. 
HTP proxy: none
Install security updates automatically
Chose software to install:  Select Open SSH server (unselect default Standard sys utilties)
Accept default (Yes) to install boot loader on the master boot record.
Continue. </p>
    

<p>If the installation is successful you will see a Log In Prompt.
Enter with your username and password. </p>

    <h2> Basic Linux admin tasks </h2>
    
    
    <p> Adding users. To add a new user named Cali, type the Linux command: <sub>sudo adduser Cali</sub>. It prompts you to create a password for Cali and add its info. To check if the user Cali is added, type the Linux command: <sub>cat /etc/passwd</sub> (to read passwd file). At the bottom of this file are listed users. </p>
    


    <p> To remove user Cali, type Linux command:<sub> sudo userdel Cali</sub>. You can check that Cali is removed by reading the passwd file again. However, the data associated with user is not removed. If you type the Linux command: <sub>cd /home</sub>. Followed by the command: <sub>ls -al</sub>. You can see that Cali's home directory is not deleted. </p>
    
    <p>To remove Cali's data type Linux command: <sub>sudo rm -R Cali</sub>. (R for remove recurrsively). </p>
    
    
       <h2> Remote access to Linux server </h2>

      <! --
            access the server remotely  
         -->
      
    <p>
         First you must get your IP address. Type the Linux command: <sub>ifconfig -a</sub>. Under emp0s3, find inet 10.1.1.. (or inet 192.168..). Write down your IP address: 10.1.1... (or 192.168..) 
          
       </p>
      
      <p>
           To access reemotely Linux server on a Windows machine download PuTTy from www.putty.org. Open PuTTy, enter your IP address, port 22, SSH. Click Open and you are prompted to log in remotely to your Linux server. 
       </p>


      <p>
           To access reemotely Linux server on a Mac use the Terminal (In the menu bar, click Go/Applications/Utilities/Terminal). Open Terminal and type ssh space IP_address. And you will be prompted to log in remotely to your Linux server.  
.
       </p>
      
 <p> To see who is logged in your machine, type the Linux command: <sub>who</sub></p>     
      
<p> To kill a remote login session, check all your running processes by typing the Linux command: <sub> ps -fu username </sub>. Look up the PID for the process, then type the Linux command <sub>kill - HUP PID_number</sub>. That sends a SIGHUP signal to a login shell that allows the application to exit properly.

<p> If your Firefox browser is unresponsive type the command: <sub> pidof firefox</sub>to get the PID then type <sub> kill- PID_number</sub>. Alternatively, you can combine the two commands into one: <sub> kill -9 $(pidof firefox)</sub> to find PID and kill it. </p>

   <h2> Updating and upgrading packages </h2>   
    
    LInux server must be updated and upgraded in order to limit any potential security risks and bugs that can affect its performance. 
    
    To update the Linux server type the command <sub> sudo apt-get update</sub>. Then type <sub> sudo apt-get upgrade</sub> to upgrade. If there are some packages left not upgraded, they can be upgraded manually.
